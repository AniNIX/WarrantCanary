To verify this message, on the terminal import our public key from pool.sks-keyservers.net and verify the canary:
$ gpg --fetch-keys https://aninix.net/AniNIX/ShadowArch/raw/branch/main/EtcFiles/aninix.gpg
$ gpg2 --fingerprint 1CC1E3F4ED06F296

sub   cv25519 2019-05-19 [E]
$ gpg --verify <(curl -s https://aninix.net/AniNIX/WarrantCanary/raw/branch/main/canary.asc) 2>&1 | grep 'Good signature'
gpg: Good signature from "DarkFeather <ircs://aninix.net:6697/DarkFeather>" [ultimate]

There will most likely be other lines in the output from that last command, but as long as it says "Good signature", the verification worked correctly.
